# Whispers on the Wind

## There's Whispers on the Wind all around us; this is just a site to collect the most interesting ones for your viewing pleasure.

The Site can be found [here](https://whispersonthewind.netlify.app/).

### General Information:

This is the frontend side of my NC News Project, built entirely by me using the knowledge taught to me by the fantastic team at Northcoders (link at bottom). It is an albiet small site which has been created to both fetch and display articles hosted in a seperate database.

Functionality includes;

- Viewing listed Articles.
- Voting on existing Articles.
- Commenting on existing Articles.
- Accessibility has been achieved via the WAVE extension on Chrome.
